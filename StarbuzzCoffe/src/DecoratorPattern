This pattern application is when we want to plugin a certain peice of code
to another peice of code . In the coffe example we might want to add different
things to drinks like soy or whip cream. We can do this in different approaches using 
inheritance but the problem arrises is that a iced coffee should not have whip cream but 
we end up giving that functionality unnecessarily. 

So the essence of this pattern is 
"Closed for Modification but open for extension"
